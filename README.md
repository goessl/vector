# vector

An infinite dimensional vector package.
```python
>>> from vector import Vector
>>> v = Vector((1, 2))
>>> w = Vector((4, 5, 6))
>>> v+w
Vector(5, 7, 6, 0, ...)
```

## Installation

```console
pip install git+https://github.com/goessl/vector.git
```

## Usage

This package provides a single class, `Vector`, to handle infinite dimensional vectors.
A vector can be initialized in two ways:
 - With the constructor `Vector(coef)`, that takes a non-negative integer to create a basis vector with the given index, or an iterable of coefficients to create a vector with the given coefficients as the first elements.
 - With the random factory `Vector.random(n, normed=True)` for a random vector of a given dimensionality.
A static helper method `Vector.basis_tuple(i)` is also provided, that generates a basis vector in form of a tuple.
The objects are immutable (coefficients are internally stored in a tuple) and zero-indexed.
```python
>>> from vector import Vector
>>> v = Vector((1, 2, 3))
>>> w = Vector.random(3)
>>> v
Vector(1, 2, 3, 0, ...)
>>> w
Vector(-0.5613820142699765, -0.028308921297709365, 0.8270724508948077, 0, ...)
>>> Vector.basis_tuple(3)
(0, 0, 0, 1)
```

Container and sequence interfaces are implemented so the coefficients can be
- accessed by indexing: `v[2]` (coefficients not set return to 0),
- iterated over: `for c in v` (stops at last set coefficient),
- counted: `len(v)` (number of set coefficients),
- compared: `v == w` (tuple of coefficients get compared),
- shifted: `v >> 1, w << 2` &
- trimmed: `v.trim()` (trailing non-zero coefficients get removed).

Hilbert space operations are provided:
- Vector addition & subtraction `v + w, v - w`,
- scalar multiplication & division `2 * v, w / 2`,
- inner product & norm `v @ w, abs(v)` (real inner product; complex conjugation of an argument has to be handled by the user; to comply with [numpy.matmul](https://numpy.org/doc/stable/reference/generated/numpy.matmul.html)).

The multiplicative operations are overloaded to perform scalar multiplication/division if the other argument is a scalar, or elementwise multiplication/division if both operands are `Vector`s, `v*w`.

A static zero-vector `Vector.ZERO` is provided.

## profiling

For most methods a runtime comparison between different approaches has been made. The results can be found in [profiling.ipynb](profiling.ipynb) or [profiling.ipynb](profiling.pdf).
