# vector

An infinite-dimensional vector Python package.
```python
>>> from vector import vecadd
>>> vecadd((1, 2), (4, 5, 6))
(5, 7, 6)
>>> 
>>> from vector import Vector
>>> v = Vector((1, 2))
>>> w = Vector((4, 5, 6))
>>> v + w
Vector(5, 7, 6, ...)
>>> 
>>> from vector import vecnpadd
>>> vecnpadd((1, 2), ((3, 4, 5),
...                   (6, 7, 8)))
array([[4, 6, 5],
       [7, 9, 8]])
```

## Installation

```console
pip install git+https://github.com/goessl/vector.git
```

## Usage

**Enjoy the [documentation webpage](https://goessl.github.io/vector).**

## Roadmap

- [x] `zip` version between `zip` & `zip_longest`. Yields different sized
tuples. Done: [goessl/zipvar](https://github.com/goessl/zipvar)
- [x] `vecdivmod`
- [x] docstrings
- [x] `numpy` routines
- [x] multiaxis vectors: tensors?
- [ ] Complexity analysis. Perfect complexity
- [ ] dimensionality signature (e.g. `vecadd`: $\mathbb{K}^m\times\mathbb{K}^n\to\mathbb{K}^{\max{m, n}}$)
- [ ] `vechadamardminmax`
- [ ] never use `numpy.int64`, they don't detect overflows
- [ ] sparse vectors (`dict`s)
- [ ] C++ & Java version
